            <h4><br> Secure. Transparent. Flexible.</h4>
            <p><br>Starter Kit has put in place a rapid response to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on it's operations. It has done so by focusing on strengthening 3 key areas; our supply chain, our contract terms and finally our customer service.

         <p>In addition, to always being committed to offer the highest quality products and services to our customers, for 2020 Starter Kit will commit to adding an extra layer of flexibility to all present and future contract in regards of:
           <br>   <br>

            <li>Delivery dates & location</li>
            <li>  Payment terms  </li>

         <h4>Our contract terms</h4>
         <p>80% of our suppliers are located within Europe and have been able to continue their operations after the measures were implemented.
            To guarantee a fully functional supply chain able to fulfil all upcoming deliveries in 2020, the following measures have been taken:
            <br>   <br>
            <ul>
            <li>        Moved away from strongly affected areas (e.g. United Kingdom)</li>
            <li>Increased our Inventory levels</li>
            <li>Pre-ordered all stock for 2020 </li>
         </ul>
         </p>
