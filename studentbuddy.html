      <h1>Student Buddy</h1>
      <h4><br>Reinvented student customer support that goes above and beyond for your tenants.<br><br>  </h4>
      <p>
       Each new tenant’s questions take on average 8 minutes of your staff’s time during the arrival and departure periods.. 
     <br><br>  We can help you save this time, save resources, and get more done.
    <br><br>   Expensive hours are used to answer even basic questions when tenants first move in and as a room provider, you naturally want to answer all of them. However, this means your skilled employees are prevented from doing valuable work
