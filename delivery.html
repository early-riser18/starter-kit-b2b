        <p>
          Yet the high seasonality of student residences causes disproportionate operational activity during the tenants
          arrivals and departures.
          <br><br>Instead, we believe it should be as easy as counting down from 10 and pressing <i>take-off</i>.

      <h2>The operational headache</h2><br>

      <p>We’ve learned from experience that this operational attention causes struggle. Your staff’s logistical
        background isn’t their speciality and they’re asked to adapt when their time is needed most.<br><br> We’ve also
        heard that service you receive is either non-existent or restricted to a minimum. This causes what we call an
        operational headache.
