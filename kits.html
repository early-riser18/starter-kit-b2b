       <h2>Responding to the demand with welcome kits</h2><br>
      <p> New student accommodations are offering full service, hotel-like experiences with restaurants, housekeeping and social events. To please the customer, you may have tried to keep up, but often at an expense.
     <br><br>  A common offer is to supply Welcome Kits, a great choice for the international student. However, this is operationally expensive, time consuming to coordinate, and deviates efforts from your core business. <br><br>Starter Kit simplifies the process for you.
